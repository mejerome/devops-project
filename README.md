DEVOPS PROJECT

This is a devops project I am embarking on to practice some of the skills I have acquired from different systems working together.
This project shows off usage of the following devops technologies:
    • git
    • Jenkins
    • Maven
    • Ansible
    • Docker
    • Kubernetes
    • Vagrant
    • Virtualbox

You can find a repo of documentation for all systems in the docs folder.

    1. Installed Jenkins
    2. Install Docker
    3. Configured Jenkins with git, maven and docker over ssh
    4. Install Ansible
    5. Configure ansible to deploy docker container
    6. Complete CI/CD pipeline to automatically update production when changes are pushed to master branch.
