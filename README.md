# simple-devops-project
In planning out this project, I am trying to setup a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Docker and Ansible to deploy war files on a tomcat server.

For the purposes of avoid cost, I am utilizing virtualbox and vagrant to deploy my servers.

Objectives to be completed
1. Install pre-requisites: jenkins, ansible, docker etc.
2. Configure Jenkins with Maven, Git and Ansible
3. Setup a CI/CD pipeline
